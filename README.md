This program, for the purposes of demonstrating understanding of ExpressJS and internet protocol, does the following:
- Adds books to a persistent database (text file) using a POST method
- Retrieves book details using a ET method
- Implements a .gitignore file to exclude node modules from pushing to GitHub

The Internet is really really great
